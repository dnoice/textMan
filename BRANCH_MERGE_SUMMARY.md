## üéØ Merge Strategy Recommendations

### Recommended: Squash and Merge

**Pros:**
- Clean, linear history
- Single commit on main branch
- Easy to revert if needed
- Clear milestone in project history

**Cons:**
- Loses individual commit details
- Can't cherry-pick individual features

**Use when:**
- ‚úÖ You want a clean main branch history
- ‚úÖ All commits are part of a single feature
- ‚úÖ Individual commit history is not critical

### Alternative: Merge Commit (--no-ff)

**Pros:**
- Preserves full commit history
- Shows when feature was integrated
- Can see individual changes
- Easier to understand development process

**Cons:**
- More complex history graph
- More commits in main branch

**Use when:**
- ‚úÖ You want to preserve detailed history
- ‚úÖ Individual commits have significant meaning
- ‚úÖ You prefer verbose git history

### Not Recommended: Fast-Forward Merge

**Reason:** Loses the context that these commits were part of a feature branch.
