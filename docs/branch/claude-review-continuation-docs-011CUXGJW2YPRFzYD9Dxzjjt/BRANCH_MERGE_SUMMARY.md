## Impact After Merge
Every future session will:
1. Start by reading ACTIVE SESSION STATUS in CONTINUATION.md
2. Follow the 6-step START PROTOCOL
3. Create standardized branch documentation using templates
4. Follow the 8-step END PROTOCOL
5. Leave zero ambiguity for the next session

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)
If issues are discovered after merge:

```bash
# Find the merge commit
git log --oneline -10

# Revert the merge (replace MERGE_COMMIT_HASH with actual hash)
git revert -m 1 MERGE_COMMIT_HASH

# Push the revert
git push origin main
```

**Alternative:** Restore main to state before merge:
```bash
# Find commit hash before merge
git log --oneline -10

# Reset to that commit (replace HASH)
git reset --hard HASH
git push origin main --force  # Use with caution
```

**Note:** Rollback should not be needed - this is documentation only with no code changes.

## Verification After Merge
Run these commands to verify merge success:

```bash
# Check main has the changes
git checkout main
cat docs/CONTINUATION.md | head -20  # Should show ACTIVE SESSION STATUS block

# Check file size increased
wc -l docs/CONTINUATION.md  # Should be ~1,790 lines

# Check branch docs exist
ls -la docs/branch/claude-review-continuation-docs-011CUXGJW2YPRFzYD9Dxzjjt/  # Should show 5 files

# Verify git history
git log --oneline -5  # Should show merge commit
```

## Ready to Merge
This branch is ready for merge. All documentation is complete, commits are clean, and the new systems have been validated by creating this branch's documentation using the templates.

User will perform manual merge after review.
