## 🎯 NEXT SESSION PLANNED

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  NEXT SESSION FOCUS: Tool Logic Development              │
│  PRIMARY GOAL: Ensure all tools function (not dead btns) │
│  BRANCH NAME TBD: claude/textman-tool-logic-...          │
│  CRITICAL: Verify each of 34 tools actually works        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Objectives for Next Session:**

1. **⚠️ PRIMARY FOCUS: Tool Logic Development**
   - **Problem:** Need to verify all 34 tool buttons actually function
   - **Goal:** Ensure each tool has working logic, not just dead buttons
   - **User Quote:** "make sure each tool actually functions and is not a dead button"

2. **Tool Audit & Testing**
   - Systematically test all 34 tools in each category:
     - Text Transformation (uppercase, lowercase, title case, etc.)
     - Case Conversion (camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case)
     - Formatting (trim, remove numbers/punctuation, etc.)
     - Line Operations (sort, reverse, shuffle, dedupe)
     - Advanced Tools (word wrap, indent, encode/decode)
   - Document which tools work vs. which need implementation
   - Create checklist of tools requiring logic development

3. **Implement Missing Tool Logic**
   - Focus on high-priority tools first (most commonly used)
   - Implement clean, testable logic for each tool
   - Ensure proper error handling and edge cases
   - Maintain consistent UX across all tools

**Session Type:** Feature Development / Bug Fixing
**Expected Docs:** BRANCH_SUMMARY, TESTING.md (tool functionality matrix), AUDIT_REPORT

**Branch Naming Validation:**
- [ ] `claude/textman-tool-logic-[session-id]`
- [ ] Action verb: "tool-logic" (clear intent)
- [ ] Focus: Tool functionality development
- [ ] Includes session ID

**Critical Success Factors:**
- ✅ All 34 tools have functional logic (no dead buttons)
- ✅ Consistent error handling across tools
- ✅ Edge cases handled properly (empty input, special chars, etc.)
- ✅ User feedback for all tool actions (success/error messages)
- ✅ Testing matrix documents tool functionality status

**Important Notes:**
- Focus on one tool category at a time (systematic approach)
- Test each tool thoroughly before moving to next
- Document any tools that may require external libraries
- Maintain consistency with existing UI patterns

## 📝 SESSION ENTRY TEMPLATE

**Copy this template when creating a new session entry in SESSION REGISTRY:**

```markdown
### Session [SESSION-ID]
**Started:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** [🔵 PLANNING | 🟢 IN PROGRESS | 🟡 READY TO MERGE | ✅ MERGED | 🔴 BLOCKED]
**Branch:** `claude/[branch-name]`
**Focus:** [One-line description of session goal]

**Scope:**
- [Main objective 1]
- [Main objective 2]
- [Main objective 3]

**Completed:**
- [✅/🟢/⏸️/❌] [Task or accomplishment]
- [Status emoji] [Task or accomplishment]

**Commits:** [number] (update at end)
**Files Changed:** [list files]
**Next Steps:** [What should happen next - merge, continue work, etc.]

---
```

**Status Emoji Guide:**
- ✅ = Completed
- 🟢 = In progress (current task)
- ⏸️ = Paused/deferred
- ❌ = Blocked/failed
- 📝 = Documented
- 🧪 = Tested

**How to Use:**
1. At session start: Copy template, fill in Started, Status (🔵 or 🟢), Branch, Focus, Scope
2. During session: Update Completed section with progress
3. At session end: Update Status (🟡 or ✅), Commits, Files Changed, Next Steps

## ⚠️ ANTI-PATTERNS: What NOT to Do

**These actions will cause session confusion and MUST be avoided:**

### ❌ DON'T: Skip Updating ACTIVE SESSION STATUS
**Why it's bad:** Next session won't know current state
**Result:** Confusion, duplicate work, or lost progress
**Solution:** ALWAYS update at start and end of session

### ❌ DON'T: Create Session Entry Without Following START Protocol
**Why it's bad:** Missing critical context and validation
**Result:** Branch name misalignment, scope confusion
**Solution:** Follow all 6 START PROTOCOL steps in order

### ❌ DON'T: End Session Without Committing CONTINUATION.md Updates
**Why it's bad:** Session progress not recorded for next time
**Result:** Next session has stale information
**Solution:** Step 8 of END PROTOCOL - commit and push this doc

### ❌ DON'T: Leave Session Status as IN PROGRESS When Finished
**Why it's bad:** Creates ambiguity about session state
**Result:** Next session thinks work is incomplete
**Solution:** Update to 🟡 READY TO MERGE or ✅ MERGED at end

### ❌ DON'T: Delete or Modify Old Session Entries
**Why it's bad:** Loses historical context
**Result:** Can't trace decisions or understand evolution
**Solution:** NEVER delete entries, only update status

### ❌ DON'T: Create Branch Without Validating Name First
**Why it's bad:** Branch name won't match actual work
**Result:** Confusion in git history, unclear purpose
**Solution:** Use Branch Naming Validation Checklist

### ❌ DON'T: Skip SESSION REGISTRY Entry
**Why it's bad:** No record of session exists
**Result:** Work becomes invisible, can't track progress
**Solution:** Create entry at session start (START Protocol Step 4)

### ❌ DON'T: End Session With Uncommitted Changes
**Why it's bad:** Work can be lost, unclear what's done
**Result:** Next session doesn't have latest code
**Solution:** END Protocol Steps 2-3 ensure all committed and pushed

### ❌ DON'T: Assume Previous Session State
**Why it's bad:** Might work on wrong branch or duplicate effort
**Result:** Wasted time, merge conflicts
**Solution:** START Protocol Steps 1-2 verify actual state

### ❌ DON'T: Start New Work If Previous Session is BLOCKED
**Why it's bad:** Blocker might affect new work
**Result:** Cascading blocks, technical debt
**Solution:** START Protocol Step 3 - resolve blocker first

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Git Issues

**Issue: Branch push fails with 403 error**
```
Solution: Ensure branch name starts with 'claude/' and ends with session ID
Example: claude/textman-feature-011ABC (not feature-011ABC)
```

**Issue: Merge conflicts on CONTINUATION.md**
```
Solution:
1. Always pull latest main before creating new branch
2. If conflict occurs, keep the most recent session info
3. Merge manually, preserving both session histories
```

**Issue: Can't find previous branch**
```
Solution:
1. Check if it was merged: git branch --merged
2. Check remote: git branch -a
3. Review git log for merge commit
```

### Development Issues

**Issue: localStorage not persisting between sessions**
```
Solution: Check browser privacy settings, may be in incognito mode
```

**Issue: Event delegation not working for new buttons**
```
Solution: Ensure new buttons have:
1. class="tool-btn"
2. data-action="actionName" attribute
3. Method exists in TextTools/ToolManager
```

**Issue: Accordion sections not collapsing**
```
Solution: Check that section has:
1. Proper section ID
2. .collapsed class toggling
3. aria-expanded attribute updating
```

### Documentation Issues

**Issue: Branch documentation links broken**
```
Solution: Update paths in CONTINUATION.md after branch merge/rename
```

**Issue: Session ID conflicts in documentation**
```
Solution: Always use unique session IDs, check recent commits first
```

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Branch Naming Convention

**Core Principle:** Branch names MUST accurately reflect the actual work being done. The feature description should align with your session goals.

#### Format

```
claude/[project]-[feature-description]-[session-id]
```

#### Naming Rules

1. **Alignment is Critical:** The `[feature-description]` MUST match what you're actually doing
2. **Be Specific:** Use descriptive names that communicate intent
3. **Use Action Words:** Start with action verbs when possible (add, fix, refactor, update, enhance)
4. **Keep It Concise:** 3-5 words max in feature description
5. **Use Kebab-Case:** Lowercase with hyphens (not underscores or camelCase)

#### Good Examples ✅

| Branch Name | Task | Why It's Good |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| `claude/textman-ui-improvements-011ABC` | Fixing sidebar toggles, accordion, flexbox | Describes the category of work |
| `claude/textman-add-analytics-tools-012XYZ` | Adding reading level, sentiment analysis | Clear action + specific feature |
| `claude/textman-fix-export-bug-013QRS` | Fixing broken JSON export | Clear problem being solved |
| `claude/textman-refactor-event-handlers-014TUV` | Converting onclick to event delegation | Describes refactoring focus |
| `claude/review-continuation-docs-015MNO` | Improving CONTINUATION.md | Exactly what we're doing now! |

#### Bad Examples ❌

| Branch Name | Why It's Bad | Better Alternative |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `claude/textman-stuff-011ABC` | Too vague, "stuff" means nothing | `claude/textman-[specific-feature]-011ABC` |
| `claude/textman-new-feature-012XYZ` | Doesn't say WHAT feature | `claude/textman-add-templates-012XYZ` |
| `claude/textman-updates-013QRS` | Generic, could mean anything | `claude/textman-update-css-styles-013QRS` |
| `claude/textman-work-014TUV` | Completely meaningless | `claude/textman-fix-mobile-layout-014TUV` |
| `claude/textman-improvements-015MNO` | Too broad when doing specific task | `claude/textman-improve-accessibility-015MNO` |

#### Pre-Creation Validation Checklist

Before creating a new branch, ask yourself:

- [ ] **Does the name describe the actual work I'm about to do?**
- [ ] **Would someone reading this name in 6 months understand what it was for?**
- [ ] **Is it specific enough to differentiate from other similar work?**
- [ ] **Does it use an action word that conveys intent?** (add, fix, update, refactor, enhance, etc.)
- [ ] **Is it concise but informative?** (3-5 words in feature description)
- [ ] **Does it follow kebab-case convention?**
- [ ] **Does it include the correct session ID?**

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Pitfall 1: Generic Names**
```bash
# Bad
git checkout -b claude/textman-updates-011ABC

# Good
git checkout -b claude/textman-add-history-persistence-011ABC
```

❌ **Pitfall 2: Scope Creep in Name**
```bash
# Bad (doing analytics but named for UI)
git checkout -b claude/textman-ui-fixes-011ABC  # But actually adding analytics

# Good (name matches actual work)
git checkout -b claude/textman-add-analytics-dashboard-011ABC
```

❌ **Pitfall 3: Action Mismatch**
```bash
# Bad (fixing but called "add")
git checkout -b claude/textman-add-sidebar-011ABC  # But sidebar exists, just broken

# Good (accurate action verb)
git checkout -b claude/textman-fix-sidebar-toggle-011ABC
```

#### When to Rename/Create New Branch

If you discover the work is different than the branch name suggests:

1. **Small Deviation:** Keep branch, note in commit messages
2. **Major Deviation:** Create new branch with accurate name
3. **Complete Pivot:** Discuss with user, likely create new branch

**Example:** Started on `claude/textman-add-tooltips-011ABC` but ended up refactoring entire UI? Create `claude/textman-refactor-ui-011ABC` instead.

## 📚 Codebase Architecture (As of Last Session)

### Key Patterns Used

**Event Delegation:**
```javascript
// All tool buttons use data-action attributes
// Single listener handles all tool clicks
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    const btn = e.target.closest('.tool-btn[data-action]');
    if (btn) handleToolAction(btn.getAttribute('data-action'));
});
```

**State Persistence:**
```javascript
// Sidebar and accordion states saved to localStorage
Storage.save(`section_${section.id}`, isCollapsed);
// Restored on page load
restoreStates();
```

**Accordion Pattern:**
```javascript
// Consistent accordion implementation
// Works on both left (panel-section) and right (tool-section) sidebars
toggleSection(header) {
    section.classList.toggle('collapsed');
    header.setAttribute('aria-expanded', !isCollapsed);
}
```

### Key Classes/IDs to Know

**Sidebars:**
- `#leftSidebar` / `#rightSidebar` - Main sidebar containers
- `.sidebar-collapsed` - Collapsed state class
- `.sidebar-float-toggle` - Floating toggle buttons

**Accordions:**
- `.panel-section` - Left sidebar sections
- `.tool-section` - Right sidebar sections
- `.panel-header` / `.tool-section-title` - Section headers (h3 elements)
- `.panel-content` / `.tool-section-content` - Section content

**Tools:**
- `.tool-btn[data-action]` - All tool buttons with action routing
- `.tool-grid` - Grid layout for tool buttons

## 🎬 Starting a New Session - Quick Checklist

When you start a new session with Claude:

1. **Read this file first** to understand current state
2. **Check git status:**
   ```bash
   git status
   git branch -a
   git log --oneline -10
   ```

3. **Ask these questions:**
   - [ ] Was the previous branch merged?
   - [ ] Are we starting a new feature?
   - [ ] Continuing existing work?
   - [ ] Fixing issues?

4. **Create new branch** (if starting new work):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b claude/textman-[feature]-[new-session-id]
   ```
   **IMPORTANT:** Use the branch naming validation checklist (see Development Guidelines section)

5. **Review relevant docs:**
   - Previous branch docs (if applicable)
   - This continuation guide
   - User requirements

6. **Set up todos** (if multi-step task):
   - Use TodoWrite tool to track progress
   - Break down large tasks
   - Keep user informed

## 💼 Session Best Practices

### During Active Development

**DO:**
- ✅ Use TodoWrite for multi-step tasks (3+ steps)
- ✅ Mark todos complete immediately after finishing each task
- ✅ Keep exactly ONE todo as in_progress at any time
- ✅ Commit frequently with clear messages
- ✅ Update user on progress regularly
- ✅ Read files before editing them
- ✅ Test changes as you go
- ✅ Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear
- ✅ Use event delegation pattern for new event listeners
- ✅ Follow semantic HTML practices (h1→h2→h3)
- ✅ Include ARIA attributes for accessibility

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Mark tasks complete if they have errors or are partial
- ❌ Create new files without checking if similar files exist
- ❌ Make assumptions about user preferences - ask first
- ❌ Skip testing after making changes
- ❌ Commit everything in one large commit
- ❌ Use inline onclick handlers (use event delegation)
- ❌ Skip accessibility attributes
- ❌ Create documentation files unless requested
- ❌ Push to wrong branch

### Communication Style

**With User:**
- Use "partner" address (user preference)
- Be concise but thorough
- Provide progress updates for long tasks
- Show what you're about to do before doing it
- Explain technical decisions when relevant

**In Code:**
- Clear, descriptive comments
- Self-documenting function/variable names

## 🎓 Lessons Learned from Past Sessions

### Session 011CUX91zuZkfD4P3s8vvBtc - UI Improvements

**What Went Well:**
- ✅ **Incremental approach:** Tackling HTML, then CSS, then JavaScript separately made changes manageable
- ✅ **Event delegation pattern:** Replacing 50+ inline onclick handlers with event delegation significantly improved maintainability
- ✅ **Comprehensive audits:** 100% audit pass rate gave confidence in code quality
- ✅ **Detailed documentation:** ~3,000+ lines of documentation made handoff seamless
- ✅ **State persistence:** Using localStorage for UI states improved user experience
- ✅ **Semantic HTML:** Proper heading hierarchy (h1→h2→h3) improved accessibility and SEO

**Challenges Overcome:**
- 🔧 **Flexbox overflow issues:** Solved with min-height: 0 on flex children
- 🔧 **Browser default interference:** Fixed by explicitly styling h3 elements to override defaults
- 🔧 **Accordion animations:** Used will-change property for smooth performance
- 🔧 **Button ID conflicts:** Created 50+ unique IDs for proper event routing

**Key Insights:**
1. **Event delegation is crucial:** Single listener > 50 inline handlers
2. **Explicit CSS is better:** Don't rely on browser defaults for important elements
3. **Accessibility first:** ARIA attributes should be included from the start, not added later
4. **Test incrementally:** Catching issues early is easier than debugging at the end
5. **Document as you go:** End-of-session documentation is harder than documenting during work

**Patterns to Repeat:**
- ✅ Event delegation for all new interactive elements
- ✅ State persistence via localStorage for UI preferences
- ✅ Comprehensive ARIA attributes on first implementation
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure from the beginning
- ✅ Incremental commits (one logical unit per commit)

**Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Inline onclick handlers (use event delegation)
- ❌ Assuming browser defaults are consistent (be explicit)
- ❌ Adding accessibility as an afterthought (include from start)
- ❌ Large monolithic commits (break into logical units)
- ❌ Generic variable/function names (be descriptive)

### Session 011CUXGJW2YPRFzYD9Dxzjjt - Documentation Improvements

**What Went Well:**
- ✅ **Branch name alignment:** Created branch with accurate name for documentation work
- ✅ **Comprehensive examples:** Added good/bad branch naming examples with explanations
- ✅ **Validation checklist:** Gave clear criteria for branch naming decisions
- ✅ **Troubleshooting section:** Addressed common issues proactively
- ✅ **Best practices guide:** Created actionable guidelines for future sessions

**Key Insights:**
1. **Branch naming matters:** Clear names help with organization and understanding
2. **Examples are powerful:** Good vs bad comparisons clarify concepts effectively
3. **Checklists prevent mistakes:** Validation criteria catch issues before they happen
4. **Documentation evolves:** It's okay to improve documentation based on lessons learned
5. **Structure aids comprehension:** Well-organized docs are easier to navigate and use

**Patterns to Repeat:**
- ✅ Use validation checklists before creating branches
- ✅ Provide concrete examples (good and bad)
- ✅ Add troubleshooting sections proactively
- ✅ Keep documentation updated with lessons learned
- ✅ Use tables for comparison (easier to scan)

### Cross-Session Patterns

**Communication:**
- User appreciates "partner" address - keep using it
- Concise but thorough explanations work well
- Progress updates during long tasks are valued
- Asking clarifying questions is better than assuming

**Code Quality:**
- Accessibility is non-negotiable (WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum)
- Semantic HTML improves maintainability and SEO
- Event delegation scales better than inline handlers
- State persistence enhances user experience

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive > minimal (user values thoroughness)
- Organized structure (dedicated directories) aids navigation
- Examples and tables improve clarity
- Update CONTINUATION.md at end of each session

**Git Workflow:**
- Descriptive branch names prevent confusion
- Small, frequent commits > large monolithic commits
- Always include co-authorship attribution
- Document before requesting merge

### Future Recommendations

**For Next Claude Instance:**
1. Read CONTINUATION.md completely before starting work
2. Validate branch name using checklist before creating branch
3. Use TodoWrite for tasks with 3+ steps
4. Commit after each logical unit of work
5. Test incrementally as you build
6. Ask clarifying questions when requirements unclear
7. Create documentation at end of session
8. Update CONTINUATION.md with session summary

**For Future Features:**
1. Consider accessibility from the start, not as afterthought
2. Use event delegation pattern for all interactive elements
3. Persist user preferences via localStorage
4. Follow semantic HTML practices
5. Include comprehensive ARIA attributes
6. Test keyboard navigation thoroughly
7. Ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
