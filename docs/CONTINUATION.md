   - Ensure consistency with current codebase

3. **Auxiliary Files Creation** (User will provide guidance)
   - 3.1: Main README.md (project overview, setup, usage)
   - 3.2: Global .gitignore (exclude unnecessary files)
   - 3.3: Global .env for security 🔒 CRITICAL
   - 3.4: Additional auxiliary artifacts (Claude to continue)

**Session Type:** Code Review + Documentation + Infrastructure
**Expected Docs:** README, BRANCH_SUMMARY, PR_DESCRIPTION, MERGE_SUMMARY + AUDIT_REPORT (code review), SECURITY.md (.env security), LESSONS_LEARNED

**Branch Naming Validation:**
- [ ] Reflects actual work (e.g., `claude/textman-codebase-review-auxiliary-[session-id]`)
- [ ] Use action verb (review, add, create)
- [ ] Concise but descriptive
- [ ] Includes session ID

**Important Notes:**
- User will provide specific guidance for auxiliary files during session
- Security (.env) is CRITICAL priority
- This will be first session using the new bulletproof system!

## 📋 SESSION START PROTOCOL

**EVERY new session MUST complete these steps in order:**

### Step 1: Read Active Session Status (Above)
- [ ] Check current session status
- [ ] Identify if previous session is merged or in-progress
- [ ] Note any blocked states or dependencies

### Step 2: Check Git State
```bash
git status
git branch -a
git log --oneline -10
git branch --merged main
```

- [ ] Confirm current branch
- [ ] Check if previous session branch was merged
- [ ] Review recent commits

### Step 3: Determine Session Type

**If previous session is MERGED (✅):**
- [ ] Checkout main: `git checkout main`
- [ ] Pull latest: `git pull origin main`
- [ ] Create new branch with validated name (see Branch Naming Convention)
- [ ] Proceed to Step 4

**If previous session is IN PROGRESS (🟢) or READY TO MERGE (🟡):**
- [ ] Ask user: "Continue on existing branch or create new one?"
- [ ] If continue: Stay on current branch
- [ ] If new: Create new branch, make note in session log
- [ ] Proceed to Step 4

**If previous session is BLOCKED (🔴):**
- [ ] Read block reason in session log
- [ ] Ask user if blocker is resolved
- [ ] Update status accordingly
- [ ] Proceed to Step 4

### Step 4: Create Session Entry
- [ ] Add new entry to SESSION REGISTRY (below)
- [ ] Update ACTIVE SESSION STATUS block (above)
- [ ] Set session status to 🔵 PLANNING or 🟢 IN PROGRESS

### Step 5: Confirm Work Scope
- [ ] Discuss with user what will be done this session
- [ ] Validate branch name matches work scope
- [ ] Create TodoWrite list if 3+ steps
- [ ] Update session entry with confirmed scope

### Step 6: Begin Work
- [ ] Mark session status as 🟢 IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Proceed with development

**✅ START PROTOCOL COMPLETE - Begin work**

---

## 📋 SESSION END PROTOCOL

**EVERY session MUST complete these steps before ending:**

### Step 1: Verify All Todos Complete
- [ ] All TodoWrite items marked complete or removed
- [ ] No pending tasks left unfinished
- [ ] All errors resolved

### Step 2: Commit All Changes
- [ ] All changes committed with descriptive messages
- [ ] Commit messages include co-authorship
- [ ] No uncommitted changes: `git status` shows clean or ahead

### Step 3: Push to Remote
- [ ] Branch pushed: `git push -u origin [branch-name]`
- [ ] Verify push succeeded (check for 403 errors)
- [ ] Confirm branch visible on remote: `git branch -a`

### Step 4: Update Session Entry in Registry
- [ ] Update session entry with accomplishments
- [ ] List all files changed
- [ ] Note commit count
- [ ] Update session status (🟡 READY TO MERGE or ✅ MERGED)

### Step 5: Update ACTIVE SESSION STATUS Block
- [ ] Update STATUS field (🟡 or ✅)
- [ ] Update LAST UPDATED timestamp
- [ ] Add any notes or blockers

### Step 6: Create Branch Documentation
- [ ] Create `docs/branch/[branch-name]/` directory
- [ ] Create required documents (see BRANCH DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM below)
- [ ] Create conditional documents based on session type
- [ ] Verify all documents using validation checklist

### Step 7: Provide Session Summary to User
- [ ] Summarize accomplishments
- [ ] List files changed and commit count
- [ ] Provide branch status
- [ ] Suggest next steps
- [ ] Ask about merge preference

### Step 8: Commit Updated CONTINUATION.md
- [ ] Commit this document with session updates
- [ ] Push to remote
- [ ] Verify push succeeded

**✅ END PROTOCOL COMPLETE - Session properly closed**

## ⚠️ ANTI-PATTERNS: What NOT to Do

**These actions will cause session confusion and MUST be avoided:**

### ❌ DON'T: Skip Updating ACTIVE SESSION STATUS
**Why it's bad:** Next session won't know current state
**Result:** Confusion, duplicate work, or lost progress
**Solution:** ALWAYS update at start and end of session

### ❌ DON'T: Create Session Entry Without Following START Protocol
**Why it's bad:** Missing critical context and validation
**Result:** Branch name misalignment, scope confusion
**Solution:** Follow all 6 START PROTOCOL steps in order

### ❌ DON'T: End Session Without Committing CONTINUATION.md Updates
**Why it's bad:** Session progress not recorded for next time
**Result:** Next session has stale information
**Solution:** Step 8 of END PROTOCOL - commit and push this doc

### ❌ DON'T: Leave Session Status as IN PROGRESS When Finished
**Why it's bad:** Creates ambiguity about session state
**Result:** Next session thinks work is incomplete
**Solution:** Update to 🟡 READY TO MERGE or ✅ MERGED at end

### ❌ DON'T: Delete or Modify Old Session Entries
**Why it's bad:** Loses historical context
**Result:** Can't trace decisions or understand evolution
**Solution:** NEVER delete entries, only update status

### ❌ DON'T: Create Branch Without Validating Name First
**Why it's bad:** Branch name won't match actual work
**Result:** Confusion in git history, unclear purpose
**Solution:** Use Branch Naming Validation Checklist

### ❌ DON'T: Skip SESSION REGISTRY Entry
**Why it's bad:** No record of session exists
**Result:** Work becomes invisible, can't track progress
**Solution:** Create entry at session start (START Protocol Step 4)

### ❌ DON'T: End Session With Uncommitted Changes
**Why it's bad:** Work can be lost, unclear what's done
**Result:** Next session doesn't have latest code
**Solution:** END Protocol Steps 2-3 ensure all committed and pushed

### ❌ DON'T: Assume Previous Session State
**Why it's bad:** Might work on wrong branch or duplicate effort
**Result:** Wasted time, merge conflicts
**Solution:** START Protocol Steps 1-2 verify actual state

### ❌ DON'T: Start New Work If Previous Session is BLOCKED
**Why it's bad:** Blocker might affect new work
**Result:** Cascading blocks, technical debt
**Solution:** START Protocol Step 3 - resolve blocker first

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Git Issues

**Issue: Branch push fails with 403 error**
```
Solution: Ensure branch name starts with 'claude/' and ends with session ID
Example: claude/textman-feature-011ABC (not feature-011ABC)
```

**Issue: Merge conflicts on CONTINUATION.md**
```
Solution:
1. Always pull latest main before creating new branch
2. If conflict occurs, keep the most recent session info
3. Merge manually, preserving both session histories
```

**Issue: Can't find previous branch**
```
Solution:
1. Check if it was merged: git branch --merged
2. Check remote: git branch -a
3. Review git log for merge commit
```

### Development Issues

**Issue: localStorage not persisting between sessions**
```
Solution: Check browser privacy settings, may be in incognito mode
```

**Issue: Event delegation not working for new buttons**
```
Solution: Ensure new buttons have:
1. class="tool-btn"
2. data-action="actionName" attribute
3. Method exists in TextTools/ToolManager
```

**Issue: Accordion sections not collapsing**
```
Solution: Check that section has:
1. Proper section ID
2. .collapsed class toggling
3. aria-expanded attribute updating
```

### Documentation Issues

**Issue: Branch documentation links broken**
```
Solution: Update paths in CONTINUATION.md after branch merge/rename
```

**Issue: Session ID conflicts in documentation**
```
Solution: Always use unique session IDs, check recent commits first
```

## 🔧 Development Guidelines

### Branch Naming Convention

**Core Principle:** Branch names MUST accurately reflect the actual work being done. The feature description should align with your session goals.

#### Format

```
claude/[project]-[feature-description]-[session-id]
```

#### Naming Rules

1. **Alignment is Critical:** The `[feature-description]` MUST match what you're actually doing
2. **Be Specific:** Use descriptive names that communicate intent
3. **Use Action Words:** Start with action verbs when possible (add, fix, refactor, update, enhance)
4. **Keep It Concise:** 3-5 words max in feature description
5. **Use Kebab-Case:** Lowercase with hyphens (not underscores or camelCase)

#### Good Examples ✅

| Branch Name | Task | Why It's Good |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| `claude/textman-ui-improvements-011ABC` | Fixing sidebar toggles, accordion, flexbox | Describes the category of work |
| `claude/textman-add-analytics-tools-012XYZ` | Adding reading level, sentiment analysis | Clear action + specific feature |
| `claude/textman-fix-export-bug-013QRS` | Fixing broken JSON export | Clear problem being solved |
| `claude/textman-refactor-event-handlers-014TUV` | Converting onclick to event delegation | Describes refactoring focus |
| `claude/review-continuation-docs-015MNO` | Improving CONTINUATION.md | Exactly what we're doing now! |

#### Bad Examples ❌

| Branch Name | Why It's Bad | Better Alternative |
|-------------|--------------|-------------------|
| `claude/textman-stuff-011ABC` | Too vague, "stuff" means nothing | `claude/textman-[specific-feature]-011ABC` |
| `claude/textman-new-feature-012XYZ` | Doesn't say WHAT feature | `claude/textman-add-templates-012XYZ` |
| `claude/textman-updates-013QRS` | Generic, could mean anything | `claude/textman-update-css-styles-013QRS` |
| `claude/textman-work-014TUV` | Completely meaningless | `claude/textman-fix-mobile-layout-014TUV` |
| `claude/textman-improvements-015MNO` | Too broad when doing specific task | `claude/textman-improve-accessibility-015MNO` |

#### Pre-Creation Validation Checklist

Before creating a new branch, ask yourself:

- [ ] **Does the name describe the actual work I'm about to do?**
- [ ] **Would someone reading this name in 6 months understand what it was for?**
- [ ] **Is it specific enough to differentiate from other similar work?**
- [ ] **Does it use an action word that conveys intent?** (add, fix, update, refactor, enhance, etc.)
- [ ] **Is it concise but informative?** (3-5 words in feature description)
- [ ] **Does it follow kebab-case convention?**
- [ ] **Does it include the correct session ID?**

#### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Pitfall 1: Generic Names**
```bash
# Bad
git checkout -b claude/textman-updates-011ABC

# Good
git checkout -b claude/textman-add-history-persistence-011ABC
```

❌ **Pitfall 2: Scope Creep in Name**
```bash
# Bad (doing analytics but named for UI)
git checkout -b claude/textman-ui-fixes-011ABC  # But actually adding analytics

# Good (name matches actual work)
git checkout -b claude/textman-add-analytics-dashboard-011ABC
```

❌ **Pitfall 3: Action Mismatch**
```bash
# Bad (fixing but called "add")
git checkout -b claude/textman-add-sidebar-011ABC  # But sidebar exists, just broken

# Good (accurate action verb)
git checkout -b claude/textman-fix-sidebar-toggle-011ABC
```

#### When to Rename/Create New Branch

If you discover the work is different than the branch name suggests:

1. **Small Deviation:** Keep branch, note in commit messages
2. **Major Deviation:** Create new branch with accurate name
3. **Complete Pivot:** Discuss with user, likely create new branch

**Example:** Started on `claude/textman-add-tooltips-011ABC` but ended up refactoring entire UI? Create `claude/textman-refactor-ui-011ABC` instead.

## 📚 Codebase Architecture (As of Last Session)

### Key Patterns Used

**Event Delegation:**
```javascript
// All tool buttons use data-action attributes
// Single listener handles all tool clicks
document.addEventListener('click', (e) => {
    const btn = e.target.closest('.tool-btn[data-action]');
    if (btn) handleToolAction(btn.getAttribute('data-action'));
});
```

**State Persistence:**
```javascript
// Sidebar and accordion states saved to localStorage
Storage.save(`section_${section.id}`, isCollapsed);
// Restored on page load
restoreStates();
```

**Accordion Pattern:**
```javascript
// Consistent accordion implementation
// Works on both left (panel-section) and right (tool-section) sidebars
toggleSection(header) {
    section.classList.toggle('collapsed');
    header.setAttribute('aria-expanded', !isCollapsed);
}
```

### Key Classes/IDs to Know

**Sidebars:**
- `#leftSidebar` / `#rightSidebar` - Main sidebar containers
- `.sidebar-collapsed` - Collapsed state class
- `.sidebar-float-toggle` - Floating toggle buttons

**Accordions:**
- `.panel-section` - Left sidebar sections
- `.tool-section` - Right sidebar sections
- `.panel-header` / `.tool-section-title` - Section headers (h3 elements)
- `.panel-content` / `.tool-section-content` - Section content

**Tools:**
- `.tool-btn[data-action]` - All tool buttons with action routing
- `.tool-grid` - Grid layout for tool buttons

## 🎓 Lessons Learned from Past Sessions

### Session 011CUX91zuZkfD4P3s8vvBtc - UI Improvements

**What Went Well:**
- ✅ **Incremental approach:** Tackling HTML, then CSS, then JavaScript separately made changes manageable
- ✅ **Event delegation pattern:** Replacing 50+ inline onclick handlers with event delegation significantly improved maintainability
- ✅ **Comprehensive audits:** 100% audit pass rate gave confidence in code quality
- ✅ **Detailed documentation:** ~3,000+ lines of documentation made handoff seamless
- ✅ **State persistence:** Using localStorage for UI states improved user experience
- ✅ **Semantic HTML:** Proper heading hierarchy (h1→h2→h3) improved accessibility and SEO

**Challenges Overcome:**
- 🔧 **Flexbox overflow issues:** Solved with min-height: 0 on flex children
- 🔧 **Browser default interference:** Fixed by explicitly styling h3 elements to override defaults
- 🔧 **Accordion animations:** Used will-change property for smooth performance
- 🔧 **Button ID conflicts:** Created 50+ unique IDs for proper event routing

**Key Insights:**
1. **Event delegation is crucial:** Single listener > 50 inline handlers
2. **Explicit CSS is better:** Don't rely on browser defaults for important elements
3. **Accessibility first:** ARIA attributes should be included from the start, not added later
4. **Test incrementally:** Catching issues early is easier than debugging at the end
5. **Document as you go:** End-of-session documentation is harder than documenting during work

**Patterns to Repeat:**
- ✅ Event delegation for all new interactive elements
- ✅ State persistence via localStorage for UI preferences
- ✅ Comprehensive ARIA attributes on first implementation
- ✅ Semantic HTML structure from the beginning
- ✅ Incremental commits (one logical unit per commit)

**Patterns to Avoid:**
- ❌ Inline onclick handlers (use event delegation)
- ❌ Assuming browser defaults are consistent (be explicit)
- ❌ Adding accessibility as an afterthought (include from start)
- ❌ Large monolithic commits (break into logical units)
- ❌ Generic variable/function names (be descriptive)

### Session 011CUXGJW2YPRFzYD9Dxzjjt - Documentation Improvements

**What Went Well:**
- ✅ **Branch name alignment:** Created branch with accurate name for documentation work
- ✅ **Comprehensive examples:** Added good/bad branch naming examples with explanations
- ✅ **Validation checklist:** Gave clear criteria for branch naming decisions
- ✅ **Troubleshooting section:** Addressed common issues proactively
- ✅ **Best practices guide:** Created actionable guidelines for future sessions

**Key Insights:**
1. **Branch naming matters:** Clear names help with organization and understanding
2. **Examples are powerful:** Good vs bad comparisons clarify concepts effectively
3. **Checklists prevent mistakes:** Validation criteria catch issues before they happen
4. **Documentation evolves:** It's okay to improve documentation based on lessons learned
5. **Structure aids comprehension:** Well-organized docs are easier to navigate and use

**Patterns to Repeat:**
- ✅ Use validation checklists before creating branches
- ✅ Provide concrete examples (good and bad)
- ✅ Add troubleshooting sections proactively
- ✅ Keep documentation updated with lessons learned
- ✅ Use tables for comparison (easier to scan)

### Cross-Session Patterns

**Communication:**
- User appreciates "partner" address - keep using it
- Concise but thorough explanations work well
- Progress updates during long tasks are valued
- Asking clarifying questions is better than assuming

**Code Quality:**
- Accessibility is non-negotiable (WCAG 2.1 Level AA minimum)
- Semantic HTML improves maintainability and SEO
- Event delegation scales better than inline handlers
- State persistence enhances user experience

**Documentation:**
- Comprehensive > minimal (user values thoroughness)
- Organized structure (dedicated directories) aids navigation
- Examples and tables improve clarity
- Update CONTINUATION.md at end of each session

**Git Workflow:**
- Descriptive branch names prevent confusion
- Small, frequent commits > large monolithic commits
- Always include co-authorship attribution
- Document before requesting merge

### Future Recommendations

**For Next Claude Instance:**
1. Read CONTINUATION.md completely before starting work
2. Validate branch name using checklist before creating branch
3. Use TodoWrite for tasks with 3+ steps
4. Commit after each logical unit of work
5. Test incrementally as you build
6. Ask clarifying questions when requirements unclear
7. Create documentation at end of session
8. Update CONTINUATION.md with session summary

**For Future Features:**
1. Consider accessibility from the start, not as afterthought
2. Use event delegation pattern for all interactive elements
3. Persist user preferences via localStorage
4. Follow semantic HTML practices
5. Include comprehensive ARIA attributes
6. Test keyboard navigation thoroughly
7. Ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance
